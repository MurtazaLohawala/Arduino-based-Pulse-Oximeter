# Arduino-based-Pulse-Oximeter
Welcome to the Arduino-Based Pulse Oximeter project! This repository contains all the necessary code, schematics, and documentation to build your own pulse oximeter using an Arduino microcontroller. A pulse oximeter is a non-invasive device used to measure the oxygen saturation level (SpO2) in the blood and pulse rate.
