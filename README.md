# Arduino-based-Pulse-Oximeter
Welcome to the Arduino-Based Pulse Oximeter project! This repository contains all the necessary code, schematics, and documentation to build your own pulse oximeter using an Arduino microcontroller. A pulse oximeter is a non-invasive device used to measure the oxygen saturation level (SpO2) in the blood and pulse rate.

An Arduino-based pulse oximeter to measure oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate.

Features
Measures oxygen saturation (SpO2)
Tracks pulse rate (BPM)
Real-time display on OLED
Compact and portable

Components
Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
Pulse oximeter sensor (e.g., MAX30100, MAX30102)
OLED display (e.g., 0.96" I2C OLED)
Breadboard and jumper wires
